  <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p class="one">My name is Melvin Kenneth Maduro Mingoa, a Filipino first-generation college student, born in the Philippines and raised in San Francisco. <br>
      <br>
      I have always explored the inner workings of my mind and experimented with different artistic concepts and methods. I have many experiences exploring and coordinating in nature and use that as an inspiration to what I paint, draw, or
      conceptualize. Starting with my first transition into painting, then sculpture and photography, this website fully codded by myself, represents my journey to further allow a larger toolset to express myself and reflect the way I look at things.
      I am especially focused on the perspective relativity on many topics and the internal bias that I or others may have. I desire to show messages and stories through art that can be shown in a new way or in a way I find unique.

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p> My art shows the constant exploration I have with every medium I learn and reflects my current feelings of the world around me. As a multimedia artist, I use each medium I have learned to better explain the feelings and stories I want to
      convey. Whether it was my short stories and charcoal sketches, to learning how to paint and express emotions and ideals, capturing the decisive moment in photography for my friends and in events, to my current works of exploring the digital
      world in a semi-physical way, Iâ€™ve always loved utilizing the tools I have in their fullest capacity. As a person who always pursued showing a message to a large audience of wide backgrounds, my goal has always been to make the art more
      approachable and friendly to those who may not have any experience in art. There are things in art that reflect how we feel in our lives, and I want that to be a shared experience between those that have seen my work. Not just an exclusive
      insight for those who have gathered that knowledge to read into my art.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> These works are a physical representation of my exploration into my own mind, and the surroundings around me. I did not create them with a singular driven purpose besides the desire to document how things feel in my perspective and how I
      would perceive them. As I continued to progress my technical skills within practicing a new medium, I painted using different subjects and dramatic colors to highlight its effects in my oil and watercolor paintings. In my photography, I use
      light painting to give the most effect to the emotion of the person and applying that same painting knowledge to encapsulate the feeling of the COVID pandemic. In my most recent works, I use my green screen and digital painting to create a
      layer of mixed media and reality. This is all a reflection of my feelings and messages that were conveyed as clearly as I could, without making it difficult for anyone to understand. In the future, I hope to continue doing so, making my
      messages and life spread as far as those who are interested see it.
