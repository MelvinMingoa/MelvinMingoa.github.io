  <div class="main">
    <p> My name is Melvin Kenneth Maduro Mingoa, a Filipino first-generation college student, born in the Philippines and raised in San Francisco. <br>
      <br>
      I have always explored the inner workings of my mind and experimented with different artistic concepts and methods. I have many experiences exploring and coordinating in nature and use that as an inspiration to what I paint, draw, or
      conceptualize. Starting with my first transition into painting, then sculpture and photography, this website fully codded by myself, represents my journey to further allow a larger toolset to express myself and reflect the way I look at things.
      I am especially focused on the perspective relativity on many topics and the internal bias that I or others may have. I desire to show messages and stories through art that can be shown in a new way or in a way I find unique.
