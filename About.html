    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p class="one">A Filipino first-generation college student, born in the Philippines and raised in San Francisco, I have always pursued a career in the arts. When I was around five years old, I realized I love drawing from observation. Although, I
      was still undecided what type of art I wanted to focus on. I have a strong passion for video games, and the art of making stories for others, so in middle school, I wrote poems, stories, and imagined worlds and ideas for games for others to
      play in. I became familiar with coding programs such as HTML and was fortunate to learn Photoshop shortly after. My interests in the art world began to expand in high school, upon trying out different mediums such as acrylic painting, sculpture, and 3D modeling. I wanted to utilize each skill I had learned to apply to the new ones I was introduced to.
      Eventually, I learned how to take photos in City College of San Francisco, and fully explored the use of framing objects within the frame and post-editing it to the way I like.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I have always explored the inner workings of my mind and experimented with traditional and nontraditional artistic concepts and methods, Including painting, sculpture, photography, and most recently digital media and video. I have many
      experiences exploring and coordinating people during my volunteer work in nature, and use that as an inspiration to what I paint, draw, or conceptualize. I am especially focused on the perspective I have on many topics and the internal bias
      that I or others may have, and voicing that in a clear way that I hope many can experience.

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>These works are a physical representation of my exploration into my own feelings and experiences of my life. My multi-media work explores the world around me and how it affects me and by extension, how the viewer can relate to that. My recent work is fascinated by the relationship and connection between the physical and virtual world. I use my green screen and digital painting to create a layer of mixed media and reality to explore alternative and unique modes of storytelling. This is all a reflection of my feelings and messages that were conveyed as clearly as I could, without making it difficult for anyone to understand.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> My art shows the constant exploration I have with every medium I learn and reflects my current feelings of the world around me. As a multimedia artist, I use each medium I have learned to better explain the feelings and stories I want to convey. Whether it was my short stories and charcoal sketches, to learning how to paint and express emotions and ideas, capturing the decisive moment in photography for my friends and in events, to my current works of exploring the digital world in a semi-physical way, Iâ€™ve always loved utilizing the tools I have in their fullest capacity. As a person who always pursued showing a message to a large audience of wide backgrounds, my goal has always been to make the art more approachable and friendly to those who may not have any experience in art. There are things in art that reflect how we feel in our lives, and I want that to be a shared experience between those that have seen my work. Not just an exclusive insight for those who have gathered that knowledge to read into my art.
