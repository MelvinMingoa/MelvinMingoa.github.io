			<h2>My Artist Statement</h2>
			<hr>
			<p> These works are a physical representation of both my exploration into a new medium and the journey of how I identify myself within the art world. I did not create them with a singular driven purpose so it was truly an insight as to how things feel in my perspective and how I would perceive them. As I continued to progress my technical skills within practicing a new medium, I painted every day using different subjects and dramatic colors to highlight it's effects. I understood what it meant to apply the brush past the superficial layer of reflection of reality and to gesture the brush further into the realm of what the viewer would perceive it as. To draw an apple realistically and perfectly would be a message to a viewer, but only if used correctly, would they understand that. I desire to apply this knowledge to the landscapes and various other sujects I will do, and emphasize the vastness and clarity of the moment in which you permeate the world around you. <br>
			<br>
			I am a traditional artist that has practiced observational drawing skills which influenced most of my works, to be solid and stagnant as I would outline them and further detail them as I go. While in the works you see today, I explored doing the exact opposite and portrayed things I didn’t know what it was, until after. Pure abstract works didn’t appeal to me, as I did not like the ambiguity of a meaning lost to some, and clear to others. So I liked to bring context to the entire scene by contrasting the clear and the unknown. Painting a rock formation that seems like a rock, but at the same time you only know feel it should be as you see a river flowing around it. These works explore that area in your mind tries to understand something that doesn’t necessarily need to be understood.<br>  
            <br>
			Many of these works are done quite quickly, around 2-3 to 9-12 hours depending on the size, subject and medium. I like taking a quick impression of something and capturing it so that may be shared among others. Taking opposites of colors and finding ways to contrast it in a new familiar way, without making it entirely obvious that was the point. I enjoy learning new mediums and tools so that I may experiment with them as much as possible. As a retrospective to myself, all of these works are significant in the context of my life and journey as an artist. They show significant care to the depiction of the environment and mood while still keeping the technical renderings of a subject in high quality. </p>
